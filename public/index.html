        <p>Let's say you're riding in the car, and you just caught the end of a fantastic song on the radio. How do you find out what it was?</p>
        <p>You can wait half an hour for the DJ to come back on and announce the title. Or a you can mark what station you're on by tapping its name in Just Played. If you're driving, have someone else do this part!</p>
        <p>Later, when you're back home, you can look up all the songs with the touch of a button, and tap a song title to buy it from the iTunes Store.</p>

          <li>Unless you're in Portland, the first thing you'll need to do is enter a city name. From your phone's Home Screen, go into Settings and tap Just Played to change your location.</li>
          <li>Launch Just Played, and then tap the Locate button near the lower left corner. The app will connect to the network and get a list of nearby radio stations. You can delete any stations you don't care about by swiping your finger to the right over the station's name.</li>
          <li>Any time you hear a song you like, tap the name of the radio station to make a "snap" of that moment in time. If you're driving, have someone else do this for you!</li>
          <li>When you're back on your home WiFi connection, click the Reload button at the bottom center. The app will look up the title and artist for each snap, and show them in place of the radio station call letters. If a song title fails to appear, it means that the information isn't on the network yet.</li>
          <li>Tap a song title to search for it in the iTunes Store.</li>
          <li>Press the Delete button to clear out the list of snaps and make room for more.</li>
          <li>See the <a href="http://25y26z.uservoice.com">support page</a> for help, or roll up your sleeves and grab the <a href="http://github.com/undees/justplayed">source code</a> if you'd like to make changes.</li>
